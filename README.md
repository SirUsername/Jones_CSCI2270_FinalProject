# Jones_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270

Project Summary:
I will be creating a text-based game library using a random graph structure to define the locations within the game world. I will be creating an abstract character class that will be used to
define the player character. The player will navigate around the "maze" and the number of steps taken are recorded.
Using a random starting location and source destination to determine the shortest path and compare it aganst the recorded number of steps
to determine a final score.
