# Jones_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270

Project Summary:
I will be creating a text-based game library using a graph structure to define the locations within the game world. I will be creating an abstract character class that will be used to
define both the player character and the creatures that population the game board. I will include methods for, defining characters and creature game statistics, performing several graph traversals to seed the game board with
enemies, determine the longest path to a randomly placed "boss" monster, and set starting location accordingly. Additionally, I will define methods for resolving conflict between
the player character and the enemies, "leveling up" to increase character statistics.
